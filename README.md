## Usage

Instantiate `obj_pollnet` before calling any function

### Functions
* `pn_host` : create a new lobby
* `pn_game_start` : called by the host to start the game (use it when you reached the desired number of players in the lobby), since this moment, new players can't join the game
* `pn_join` : join an existing lobby
* `pn_request_games_list` : get all the online lobbies (created by other players)
* `pn_quit` : leave a lobby
* `pn_send` : send a message to one or all players (set the second parameter to `all`)
	example: `pn_send("health", all, 80)

### Events
All the scripts under `events` group are called when something happens

For example:

* `pn_on_player_join` is called when a player (included yourself) joins the lobby.
* `pn_on_player_quit` is called when a player (included yourself) leaves the lobby.

### Global Variables
* `global.pn_last_date`: last message date 
* `global.pn_players_map`: ds_map between players id and name
* `global.pn_players_list`: ds_list of players id
* `global.pn_games_list`: ds_list of games
* `global.pn_admin_id`: player id of the host


### Tips
* Create an object that lists all the available games online and allows to join
* Create a button to host a new game
* use `pn_send` to send messages with an id of your choice
* with `pn_send` you can send a `string` a `number` or an `array`
* inside the script `pn_on_receive` use a switch statement to handle the messages
* don't send too much data, this library uses HTTP connection / mysql database, to avoid performance issues.
